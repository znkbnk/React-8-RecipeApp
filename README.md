Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

- Install Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js 
installed on your machine. 
- Create a Project Folder: Create a folder
for your project. Open a terminal and navigate
to the project folder.
- Initialize a React App: Run the
npx create-react-app recipe-app
to set up a new React app using Create React App.

Step 2: Plan Your App

- Decide App Structure: Plan how your app
will be organized. Identify components
such as "Header," "RecipeList," "RecipeDetail," etc.
- Gather Data: Decide how you'll manage recipe
data. You can create a static list or fetch
data from an API. For practice, start with
a static list of recipes.

Step 3: Build Components

- Create Component Files: Inside the src folder,
create separate files for each component you
planned earlier. For example: Header.js,
RecipeList.js, RecipeDetail.js, etc.
- Write Basic Components: In each component file,
start by writing a basic functional component.
For instance, in Header.js.

Step 4: Define Data

- Create Data: Define sample recipe data in
the main App.js file or create a separate
data.js file and import it into App.js.

Step 5: Display Recipe List

- Use State: In the App.js file, import the 
necessary components and set up the initial
state for the list of recipes using the
useState hook.
- Pass Data: Pass the recipe data as a prop to
the RecipeList component.
- Render Recipe List: Inside the RecipeList.js
component, map through the recipe data and
render a list of recipe titles.

Step 6: Create Recipe Detail

- Add Click Event: Add a click event handler to 
each recipe title in the RecipeList component.
When a title is clicked, it should display 
the details of that recipe.
- Display Details: In the RecipeDetail.js
component, receive the selected recipe as a
prop and display its details.

Step 7: Styling

- Add CSS: Create a separate CSS file for your
app's styling or use inline styles. Style your
components to make your app visually appealing.

Step 8: Testing and Debugging

- Run App: Start your app by running npm start
in the terminal within your project directory.
- Test Interactions: Test your app by clicking
on recipe titles and ensuring that the details
are displayed correctly.
- Debugging: Use browser developer tools and 
console.log statements to debug any issues.
